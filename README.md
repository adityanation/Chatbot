# RAG Chatbot Web Application

## Overview
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** that provides responses based on scraped web data. The chatbot is designed to fetch real-time information, process it efficiently, and generate accurate responses. The application is deployed online for public access.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Retrieves relevant information from the internet instead of relying on a static text file.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhances chatbot responses by combining retrieval-based and generative AI approaches.
- **Web Deployment**: The chatbot is hosted online for easy accessibility.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask / FastAPI (or another suitable framework)
- **Machine Learning Model**: Transformer-based NLP model
- **Web Scraping Tools**: Requests, Scrapy, or other suitable libraries
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or Gradio for a lightweight interface)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages, Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or any cloud provider

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-chatbot.git
   cd rag-chatbot
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Access the chatbot via the deployed web link.
- Enter a query, and the chatbot will fetch relevant web information before generating a response.
- Get informative and context-aware responses based on real-time data.

## Deployment
- The chatbot can be deployed using **Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or another cloud platform**.
- Ensure all environment variables and dependencies are correctly set up before deployment.

## Future Enhancements
- **Improved Web Scraping**: Expand data sources for better information retrieval.
- **Multi-modal Capabilities**: Support for images and documents in chatbot interactions.
- **Enhanced NLP Model**: Fine-tune a custom model for better performance.
- **User Authentication**: Implement login features for personalized experiences.
